We keep separated the updates to have a clear view of what was done after deadline.
Replace files in original directory to run. (Or change dir path in import).

Note: the solution is incomplete. We need to come up with a method of encoding
categorigal data that, will be able to handle new unseen data and variable number
of categories in a feature. Also care must be taken as to how we encode the data
since if the ordering of features is different between two data sets, encoded with 
the same encoder, then the a vector (e.g. [1,0,0,0]) will represent two
different classes in each case, and that will mess the results.
